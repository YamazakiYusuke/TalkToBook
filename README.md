# TalkToBook

An Android application designed to help elderly users (65+) write books and documents using voice input, with speech-to-text conversion powered by OpenAI's Whisper API.

## üéØ Overview

TalkToBook enables seniors to create structured documents through voice recordings, automatically transcribing speech to text and organizing content into manageable chapters and documents with auto-save functionality.

### Key Features

- **Voice-to-Text**: OpenAI Whisper API integration for accurate transcription
- **Document Management**: Structured documents with chapters and auto-save
- **Senior-Friendly Design**: Accessibility-focused UI (18pt+ fonts, high contrast, large buttons)
- **Offline Support**: Queue system for processing recordings when network is available
- **Auto-Save**: Automatic content preservation during editing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Built using **Clean Architecture** with **MVVM pattern** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

- **Presentation Layer**: Jetpack Compose UI with ViewModels
- **Domain Layer**: Use cases and business logic
- **Data Layer**: Room database and Retrofit networking

### Technology Stack

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose + Material 3
- **DI**: Hilt dependency injection
- **Database**: Room for local storage
- **Network**: Retrofit + OkHttp
- **Async**: Kotlin Coroutines + Flow
- **Testing**: JUnit 4, MockK, 80%+ coverage target

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Arctic Fox or later)
- JDK 11 or higher
- Android SDK (API 29-35)
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YamazakiYusuke/TalkToBook.git
   cd TalkToBook
   ```

2. **Configure API key**
   ```kotlin
   // In util/Constants.kt
   const val OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-actual-api-key"
   ```

3. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

## üß™ Testing

The project uses **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with comprehensive test automation:

```bash
# Quick unit tests
./scripts/quick-test.sh

# Comprehensive test suite with reports
./scripts/run-tests.sh

# Specific test patterns
./scripts/test-specific.sh "*ViewModel*"
```

**Coverage Target**: 80%+ for all business logic components

## üé® Senior-Friendly Design

The application follows strict accessibility guidelines:

- **Typography**: Minimum 18pt font sizes
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 48dp button sizes  
- **Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color schemes
- **Screen Reader**: Full TalkBack support
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear interaction states

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Development Workflow

### TDD Approach
1. **Red**: Write failing test for desired functionality
2. **Green**: Implement minimum code to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining test coverage

### Layer Testing
- **Domain Layer**: Use cases and business logic (TDD required)
- **Data Layer**: Repository implementations and data sources
- **Presentation Layer**: ViewModels and UI state management
