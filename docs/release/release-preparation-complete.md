- Logging removal in release builds
- Framework-specific keep rules
```

### Build Variants
```gradle
debug {
    applicationIdSuffix = ".debug"
    versionNameSuffix = "-debug"
    isDebuggable = true
}

release {
    isMinifyEnabled = true
    isShrinkResources = true
    isDebuggable = false
    // ProGuard enabled
}
```
