### [Docker Android Debug Build Methodology](./docker-android-debug-build-methodology.md)
Comprehensive guide for building Android applications in Docker DevContainer environments, including:

- Environment setup and verification
- Common issues and solutions (daemon locks, cache corruption, KSP failures, timeouts)
- Proven build methodology (5-phase approach with cache integrity checks)
- Command reference and enhanced troubleshooting decision tree
- Performance expectations and best practices
- CI/CD integration examples with cache protection

**Key Achievements**: 
- Resolved 5-minute timeout issues
- Discovered and solved Docker cache corruption problems
- Improved success rate from 25% to 75% with cache management
- Added KSP/Room annotation processing failure recovery

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands for Docker DevContainer
```bash
# Cache integrity test (critical for Docker)
timeout 60s ./gradlew help --no-daemon --offline || echo "Cache corruption detected"

# Full cache recovery if corrupted
./gradlew --stop
rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/ app/build/generated/ app/.kotlin/

# Standard build process
./gradlew clean --no-daemon
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon --stacktrace

# KSP recovery if annotation processing fails
rm -rf app/build/generated/ksp/
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon --stacktrace
```

### Troubleshooting Checklist (Updated)
1. ✅ Test cache integrity before major builds
2. ✅ Verify environment variables (`ANDROID_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME`)
3. ✅ Stop Gradle daemons (`./gradlew --stop`)
4. ✅ Clear cache corruption if detected
5. ✅ Use `--no-daemon` flag for Docker builds
6. ✅ Allow 15+ minute timeout for cache recovery
7. ✅ Monitor for KSP/Room annotation processing failures

## Success Metrics (Updated)
- **Build Time**: 3-4 minutes (after cache recovery)
- **Cache Recovery Time**: 2-5 minutes when needed
- **APK Size**: ~60MB
- **Success Rate**: 75% with enhanced methodology (up from 25%)
- **Cache Corruption Frequency**: ~50% in long-running containers
- **Environment**: Docker DevContainer with Android SDK

Based on extensive real-world testing and troubleshooting in Docker DevContainer environment, including cache corruption scenarios.
