### [Docker Android Debug Build Methodology](./docker-android-debug-build-methodology.md)
Comprehensive guide for building Android applications in Docker DevContainer environments, including:

- Environment setup and verification
- Common issues and solutions (daemon locks, timeouts, SDK missing)
- Proven build methodology (5-phase approach)
- Command reference and troubleshooting
- Performance expectations and best practices
- CI/CD integration examples

**Key Achievement**: Resolved 5-minute timeout issues, achieving consistent 3-4 minute build times.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands for Docker DevContainer
```bash
# Stop daemons and build (recommended for Docker)
./gradlew --stop
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon --stacktrace

# Environment verification
echo "ANDROID_HOME: $ANDROID_HOME"
./gradlew --version

# Clean build when issues occur
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon
```

### Troubleshooting Checklist
1. ✅ Verify environment variables (`ANDROID_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME`)
2. ✅ Stop Gradle daemons (`./gradlew --stop`)
3. ✅ Clear cache locks if needed
4. ✅ Use `--no-daemon` flag for Docker builds
5. ✅ Allow 10+ minute timeout for first builds

## Success Metrics
- **Build Time**: 3-4 minutes (consistent)
- **APK Size**: ~60MB
- **Success Rate**: 100% with methodology
- **Environment**: Docker DevContainer with Android SDK
